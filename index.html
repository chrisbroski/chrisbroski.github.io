<h2>Web Development Utilities</h2>

<h3><a href="/Ajax-Tool/ajax_tool.html">Ajax-tester</a></h3>
<p>I created this tool to help me develop REST web services for Ajax. It has a simple interface for creating basic HTTP requests and displays formatted response body and headers.

<h3><a href="/canvas-flowchart/factorial-flowchart">Flowchart.js</a></h3>
<p>A JavaScript library for creating the most common shapes for flowchart diagrams in the HTML5 canvas element.

<h3><a href="/Unicode-Browser/unicode.html">Unicode Explorer</a></h3>
<p>This tool was made to browse the extended character set available to JavaScript and your web browser.

<h2>Mobile Web Applications</h2>

<h3><a href="/sketchpad-calculator/">Sketchpad Calculator</a></h3>
<p>Mobile web application calculator built to simulate how math is written on scratch paper. 
<a href="/sketchpad-calculator/sketchpad-calc">Initial Proof of Concept</a>.

<h3><a href="/mtg-simplescore/">MtG SimpleScore</a></h3>
<p>A simple, but complete, web application for keeping score in games of Magic the Gathering.

<h2>HTML &amp; CSS</h2>

<h3><a href="/magic-card/"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Card in Sematic HTML/css</a></h3>
<p>While working on styling for my Magic: The Gathering life counter, I attempted to create an HTML document with styles identical to the printed cards. I used the artifact creature "Pilgrim's Eye" from Battle for Zendikar as a reference.
<p>Other than gradients, rounded borders, and box-shadows, this is all CSS2. It is not perfect yets either in appearance or symantics, but it is a pretty good v1.

<h3><a href="/periodic-table-of-the-elements/periodic-table.html">Periodic Table of the Elements</a></h3>
<p>A single file implementation in HTML5 and CSS2 of the complete periodic table of the elements. Prints beautifully in landscape orientation.

<h3><a href="/simple-css/">Simple.css</a></h3>
<p>My search for the minimum CSS needed to clearly format an HTML document on both desktop and mobile browsers.
